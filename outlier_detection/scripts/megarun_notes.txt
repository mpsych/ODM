We have 176,189 total 2D images. For sake of dividing up the tasks for the big
run better we will remove 9 bad images from the total. 176,180 images remain.

We can then divide up the images into 230 groups of 766 images each.

we will be using 1 algorithm, 1 feature type and 1 normalization method.

If we use 1 core per task and allocate 8GB of RAM per core will mean we need a
total of 230 cores and 1840GB of RAM.

Images are large so we may need to downsample them to 512x512 or 256x256.
